Deleuze leest in dit rare gebeuren – die rare ‘evenementen’ – de condities van een andere dan de gangbare logica. In de gangbare logica heet de eigenschap van iets of iemand een attribuut. Dat attribuut schrijft een kenmerk toe aan een onderwerp of subject. Dat laatste wordt verondersteld een vaste, substantiële entiteit te zijn; attributen echter gelden als variabel. Alice – onderwerp/subject – is wie ze is en wat ze is; en ze kan – attribuut – groot of klein zijn. Zo klinkt het in de klassieke logica. Carrolls verhaal [Alice in Wonderland] daarentegen presenteert het ‘attribuut’ niet als een eigenschap dat vastkleeft aan een subject, maar als een actief ‘gebeuren’, een gebeuren dat opereert los van het subject waaraan het refereert. Klein of groot zijn is niet langer iets dat afhangt van wie (ofwat) klein of groot is. Hier is het attribuut autonomer; het is wat aan iemand of iets ‘gebeurt’, wat eraan ‘te beurt valt’, wat het ‘overvalt’.","coordinates":{"x":"25","y":"15"},"image":"","date":"Fri Sep 07 2018 16:35:52 GMT+0200 (Midden-Europese zomertijd)","references":"website","inputs":{"artist_name":"","year_of_artwork":"","title_artwork":"","author":"Marc de Kesel","title":"Welkom in Wonderland","series_title_and_number":"","edition":"","place_of_publication":"","publisher":"","year_of_publication":"","url":"https://marcdekesel.weebly.com/uploads/2/4/4/4/24446416/welkom_in_wonderland_-_over_zin_bij_deleuze_-_versie_boek.pdf","date_of_access":"7 November 2015","author_of_chapter":"","title_of_chapter":"","title_of_book":"","page_numbers":"","page_numbers_of_article":"","title_of_journal_article":"","title_of_conference_paper":"","title_of_journal":"","volume_number":"","issue_number":"","dio":"","submitted_to":"","year_of_writing":"","name_of_standard_body":"","standard_number":"","organisation":"","report_number":"","scale":"","sender":"","email_sent_to":"","name_of_reciever":"","date_of_communication":"","name_of_practitioner":"","occupation":"","date_of_information_provided":"","title_of_lecture":"","name_of_location":"","title_of_number_of_guideline":""}},

When tradition holds power, change cannot happen and uniformity sets in. What’s worse is that uniformity is presented under the guise of acceptable creativity and is touted for its supposed originality. Every year, thousands of high school students are told to write a five-paragraph essay delineating the rhetorical devices in a given letter, speech or proclamation, and every year, those students are patted on their backs and rewarded with good grades for turning in essays that each have the same format, the same content, the same ideas as their classmates as well as every student before them who was given the same assignment. In academia, there are implicitly right and implicitly wrong answers that help ensure the continuation of a certain status quo, so it is acceptable, even desirable, to do what everyone else is doing. Because this method has a favorable outcome for tradition, this uniformity is not considered plagiaristic and is instead regarded as acceptable, though perhaps milquetoast, originality.\r\n","coordinates":{"x":"23","y":"14"},"image":"","date":"Mon Sep 10 2018 13:36:41 GMT+0200 (Midden-Europese zomertijd)","references":"website","inputs":{"artist_name":"","year_of_artwork":"","title_artwork":"","author":"Shelley Zansler","title":"Conceptual Writing on Digital Narrative Project","series_title_and_number":"","edition":"","place_of_publication":"","publisher":"","year_of_publication":"","url":"http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/honorstheses/156/","date_of_access":"15 November 2015","author_of_chapter":"","title_of_chapter":"","title_of_book":"","page_numbers":"","page_numbers_of_article":"","title_of_journal_article":"","title_of_conference_paper":"","title_of_journal":"","volume_number":"","issue_number":"","dio":"","submitted_to":"","year_of_writing":"","name_of_standard_body":"","standard_number":"","organisation":"","report_number":"","scale":"","sender":"","email_sent_to":"","name_of_reciever":"","date_of_communication":"","name_of_practitioner":"","occupation":"","date_of_information_provided":"","title_of_lecture":"","name_of_location":"","title_of_number_of_guideline":""}},

The only descriptions of them are comparing them to chicken, beff, mutton and butter, and saying they tasted better than all of them. Even the liver and bone marrow was considered delicious. They were also used as water stores, because they have a special internal bladder which stores water so perfectly that it is drinkable, so when you slit them open to cook them you also got a gallon of fresh water. The crew therefore stacked them up so that they could not move, and they did not need to be fed for months so they were very useful for whaling ships because they provided both food and water.

In the rhizome, and in the internet, there is no central structure but an infinite number of interlocking nodes, many of which are produced from a bottom up, grass roots system that allows for each individual to have a have a voice.

When Thompson was found, the roof of his blue Honda Accord had been crushed almost to the floor. The fireman who rescued him was amazed he hadn’t been decapitated. As he’d been sitting, helpless, in the wreck, Thompson had had a vivid near-death experience. He claimed to have seen a “light so bright that it burnt my eyes” and made him “legally blind” and to have had bizarre knowledge about the world poured into him. When he regained consciousness, he was convinced that the Earth was hollow and had an opening at the North Pole.

The eye does not know its own blind spot, mistakes it for vision. Nor does the mind’s eye and so gives meaning to what is not really there. Every human brain fills in what is missing, blinding each of us to our own blind spot. A human paradox, each of us sees where we cannot and do not. The mind is positive that it sees what is really there. [...] Of this personal vision, a worldview is born and an entire life lived. Yet the center does not hold because it does not even exist.

Maybe, instead, we should teach science as an exciting examination of Things We Don’t (Yet) Know. Denied the comforting blanket of illusory permanence and absolute truth, we have the opportunity and obligation to do something extraordinary: to see the world as it is, and to understand and appreciate that our images will keep changing, not because they are fundamentally flawed, but because we keep providing ourselves with better lenses. Our reality hasn’t become unstable; it’s just that our understanding of reality is of necessity a work in progress.","coordinates":{"x":"18","y":"12"},"image":"","date":"Wed Sep 12 2018 14:12:14 GMT+0200 (Midden-Europese zomertijd)","references":"website","inputs":{"artist_name":"","year_of_artwork":"","title_artwork":"","author":"David P.

En dat werkt inderdaad, tot op zekere hoogte. We verwerven begrip van de materie door deze te splitsen in achtereenvolgens atomen, protonen, elektronen en neutronen, quarks, gluonen enzovoorts. We kunnen organismen beter begrijpen door ze terug te brengen tot organen, weefsels, cellen, organellen, proteïnen, DNA enzovoort. Het weer samenvoegen van de dingen om ze te begrijpen is veel moeilijker en komt later in de ontwikkeling van wetenschapper of wetenschap. Denk aan problemen bij het begrijpen hoe alle cellen in ons lichaam samenwerken. Vergeleken met het bestuderen van die cellen zelf. Om dat begrip te verwerven zijn volstrekt nieuwe terreinen van neurowetenschappelijk onderzoek, systeembiologie en netwerkwetenschap in opkomst.

The artwork deals with issues of creativity in science, as well as the opportunities of technology in this field. It questions the way we see the art and the science as opposites.

Poets who aim to see their work in “high culture” publications understand that a certain type of profound, unmetered lyric is the way to go. A good piece of fiction follows a slant bell-curve, and a great piece of fiction does this while also providing an underlying commentary on the contemporary sociopolitical climate. The five- paragraph essay is simultaneously scoffed at and preached; only writers who are notable enough should venture to break structure. Those with less notoriety are better off sticking to the formula and providing plenty of cited affirmation from those well-respected in the academic arena. Here it is seen how in the literary apparatus, more so than in any other, there is a strong sense of ownership—of words, structure, ideas.","coordinates":{"x":"29","y":"20"},"image":"","date":"Wed Sep 19 2018 10:13:58 GMT+0200 (Midden-Europese zomertijd)","references":"website","inputs":{"artist_name":"","year_of_artwork":"","title_artwork":"","author":"Shelley Zansler","title":"Conceptual Writing on Digital Narrative Project","series_title_and_number":"","edition":"","place_of_publication":"","publisher":"","year_of_publication":"","url":"https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1138&context=honorstheses","date_of_access":"11 November 2015","author_of_chapter":"","title_of_chapter":"","title_of_book":"","page_numbers":"","page_numbers_of_article":"","title_of_journal_article":"","title_of_conference_paper":"","title_of_journal":"","volume_number":"","issue_number":"","dio":"","submitted_to":"","year_of_writing":"","name_of_standard_body":"","standard_number":"","organisation":"","report_number":"","scale":"","sender":"","email_sent_to":"","name_of_reciever":"","date_of_communication":"","name_of_practitioner":"","occupation":"","date_of_information_provided":"","title_of_lecture":"","name_of_location":"","title_of_number_of_guideline":""}},

The non-specificity of these images, which at first is a challenge for viewers, allows them to mirror the experience of being somewhere crowded with stimuli. A viewer notices many things, but no one is defining. Tillmans duplicates this experience with his arrangements of relativity abstract photographs.

Online imagery is centered less on presenting photographs as objects of memory and more on the sharing of current experience. Pictures are endlessly streaming and reflect the messy realities of life as it’s lived.
